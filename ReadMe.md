# smc-reader
MIT licensed code for reading from the Apple System Management Control (SMC)

## About
[Apple's SMC subsystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Controller) allows you to query the system for CPU temperature, fan speeds, power usage, etc.  
There are currently many good libraries to accomplish this, but everything that I found was based on smc.cc/h which is a GPL licensed implementation.  
I felt there was a need for similar functionality under a more permissive license.

That's it.  
Enjoy!
